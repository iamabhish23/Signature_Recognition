## Overview

Signature recognition plays a pivotal role in security and verification processes. Our goal is to build an accurate and reliable CNN model capable of classifying signatures with high precision.

## Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Our implementation leverages the power of CNNs to automatically extract meaningful features from signature images.

- **Data Preprocessing**: We ensure optimal data quality by applying preprocessing techniques, including resizing and normalization.

- **Model Training**: The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing a variety of genuine and forged signatures.

- **Validation and Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using a validation dataset, and log loss serves as our evaluation metric.

- **Test Predictions**: Utilizing the trained model, we predict signatures from a separate test dataset and present results in a CSV format.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository using: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/signature-recognition.git`

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Configure dataset paths in the provided scripts.

4. Execute the scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and test predictions.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: A directory to store the signature dataset.

- `models/`: Contains saved model weights and architecture configurations.

- `src/`: Consists of Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and test predictions.

- `results/`: Contains the exported CSV file with test predictions.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries.

## Usage

1. Preprocess your signature dataset with `data_preprocessing.py`.

2. Train the CNN model using `model_training.py`.

3. Evaluate the model's performance using `model_evaluation.py`.

4. Generate predictions for test signatures using `test_predictions.py`.
